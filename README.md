# Don't Starve Together GUI Mod Creator
A GUI mod creator, similar to MCreator, for the game Don't Starve Together.

## About me
I'm an Australia programmer, who does programming as a hobby, and wouldn't mind making a buck or two. ([wink](https://ko-fi.com/L3L537JF7), [wink](https://ko-fi.com/L3L537JF7))  
I do a bit of Java, C#. I messed around in C++, a bit of Python and HTML/CSS/Javascript (also Node.js, if that's different), so generally I consider myself an all-rounder.

## About this project
This is a project (currently) solely done by me. Inspired my [this post](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/125145-how-to-mod-dst-without-coding/), I set out to make a GUI interface to create mods for a game I really like called Don't Starve Together. This is my first time doing anything like this, and first time making a github page that (hopefully) many people would see (also creating a wiki)

## How do I download?
Over on the right (at least for me), there is a selection called "Releases". Just get the most recent one. If their are any problems, create an [issue](https://github.com/decduck3/dstguimodcreator/issues/new/choose), and I'll try to get back to it as fast as possible. Same for feature request, just click this [link](https://github.com/decduck3/dstguimodcreator/issues/new/choose) and select feature request.'

## Why doesn't it work?
Most likely, I stuffed up. Open a issue (see above), and I'll see if I can replicate the bug, and then hopefully fix it!
